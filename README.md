(ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW) AUNTK-About_Github

Hey there, congratulations on taking your first step into the beautiful world of programming! Are you surprised that I guessed your position as a freshman programmer correctly? Well, it's because you're starting to learn how to use GitHub.com. But don't worry, everyone starts at the beginning. (Fun fact: Bill Gates, one of the over powered programmers, developed his first computer software, a tic-tac-toe program, and the rest is history.)

If you want to Ace at programming, you need to know GitHub.com and Git (this is my opinion, and I'm sure most will agree with me).

If you're still not convinced, here are some universal facts about programmers:

1. In this vast family of programmers, from beginner programmers to the best elite code craftsman of all time, they have all accepted that in our community of development, we need to be collaborative with other developers and rely on each other. This is because the coding community emphasizes and encourages collaborative work to enhance their coding skills and produce high-quality software for the future. GitHub.com is the flexible and best place for collaboration with other programmers all around the globe.

2. Programming is an art of copy-paste. GitHub is one of the best places out there to copy human-written codes and use them in our projects.

3. It's a perfect place to learn new technology around you.

So, don't worry about the reasons and start learning GitHub.com. I hope you become the greatest programmer of all time.
